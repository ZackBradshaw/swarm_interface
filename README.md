## Proxmox VMs and Clusters Integration via xterm.js

Chat'nFace now supports interacting with Proxmox VMs and clusters directly through an xterm.js terminal interface. This feature allows users to view and manage their VMs and clusters within the Chat'nFace application.

### Setup and Configuration

#### Frontend

1. Ensure `xterm.js` and `xterm-addon-fit` are installed in your project.
2. Integrate the `TerminalComponent` into your application where you want the terminal to appear.

#### Backend

1. Set up a WebSocket server that the frontend can connect to for real-time data streaming.
2. Implement Proxmox API integration in your backend service. This will involve authenticating with your Proxmox server and fetching or sending data as needed.
